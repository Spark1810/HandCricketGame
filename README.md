# HandCricketGame

Hand Cricket is a simple and enjoyable game played between two players. The objective of the game is to score as many runs as possible while avoiding getting out. It is a virtual adaptation of the popular game played with hands during childhood.

In Hand Cricket, you play against the computer as your opponent. The game consists of two phases: batting and bowling. During the batting phase, you enter a number between 1 and 6 to score runs. The computer also selects a random number between 1 and 6. If your number matches the computer's number, you're out. However, if the numbers are different, the runs you entered are added to your total score.

After completing the batting phase, it's time for the bowling phase. The computer selects a number between 1 and 6, and you need to enter a number to bowl. If your number matches the computer's number, the computer is out. Otherwise, the runs selected by the computer are added to its total score.

The game continues with alternating batting and bowling turns until either you or the computer gets out. Once the game is over, the total runs scored by both players are displayed. If your total runs are higher than the computer's, you win the game. If the computer's total runs are higher, you lose. In the case of a tie, it's considered a draw.

Hand Cricket is a fun and strategic game that tests your ability to predict and choose numbers. It's a great way to spend leisure time and relive nostalgic memories of playing hand cricket in a virtual setting. Enjoy the game and aim for a high score!
